# SplitKey - Distributed Computing Framework

**SplitKey** is a modular and self-contained distributed computing framework originally built to coordinate GPU mining rigs for generating vanity Bitcoin wallets. It uses a server-client architecture to divide large computational tasks into smaller pieces, distribute them to worker machines, and collect verified results efficiently.

While its roots lie in cryptography and blockchain experimentation, the underlying framework is highly adaptable. It can be repurposed for a wide range of distributed workloads such as:

- Protein folding and scientific research
- Stable Diffusion and AI image generation
- LLM-based inference distribution
- Mining rental management platforms
- General-purpose GPU task delegation
- Brute-force key exploration and prefix searching

## Features

- **Agent-Handler Architecture:** Server coordinates work; clients execute and verify it.
- **Split-Key Methodology:** Supports JeanLucPons' distributed key search and Pointbiz's key merger technique.
- **Scalable & Modular:** Build your own client-side workers with ease.
- **Secure by Design:** No client-side argument handlers are included to prevent misuse.
- **Insightful Discoveries:** Observations hint at deeper structures in ECC, SHA256+RIPEMD160, and Base58 encoding.

## Why Release It?

SplitKey operated in private for over a year and was known within the BitcoinTalk community. Due to growing concern over transparency, and in the spirit of open-source collaboration, it is now being released under the MIT License for research and development purposes.

We do **not** condone malicious use. This software is provided strictly for educational and research applications.
